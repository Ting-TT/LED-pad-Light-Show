This is the **project I did myself** for course COMP2300 Semester 1, 2022.

The assignment instructions is [here](https://comp.anu.edu.au/courses/comp2300/assessments/light-show).  
I used the assignment [templete](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/comp2300/2022/comp2300-2022-assignment-1) given by the course. Everything from the templete credits to the original writers.  
This assignment is **not currently used** for COMP2300 students.  

More information about this project please see the [design doc](https://github.com/Ting-TT/LED-pad-Light-Show/blob/main/design-document.md).
